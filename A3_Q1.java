// This program is a simulation of an ATM machine. It allows the user to check their account balance, 
// in addition to depositing and withdrawing money. The user can deposit any amount of bills between $5 and $10000
// and withdraw any amount of bills between $5 and $1000 for each transaction.
// The program uses the concepts of loops, if/if-else/if-else-if statements, and switches.
